# Public Folder Files

This folder contains two JavaScript files used for PDF generation and streaming:

   This file contains the standalone version of [PDFKit](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit/releases), a powerful PDF generation library for Node.js. It allows you to create PDFs directly in the browser or server-side.

2. **`blob-stream.js`**  
   This file is part of [Blob Stream](https://github.com/devongovett/blob-stream/releases), a small library that allows you to create binary blobs in the browser from streams, which is useful for generating downloadable files like PDFs.
