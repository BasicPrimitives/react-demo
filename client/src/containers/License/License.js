      <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>Basic Primitives provides unconditional refunds to Customers up to 30 days from the day of purchase. Customers may be asked to provide a valid reason for claiming a refund. After the first 30 days have elapsed, a refund request will normally not be accepted unless there are convincing reasons justifying a refund. During this period, Basic Primitives will usually require a Customer to provide a satisfactory explanation as to why a refund is merited and why the request was not made earlier. After 60 days purchase is deemed to be final.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the difference between the Developer type licenses and an OEM license?<br />
          The OEM license allows you to distribute a Basic Primitives software product in your software or hardware product to be installed on client hardware. However, if you're setting up sites and web applications for a client as a contract job, you are allowed to do this under the Developer type licenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          How do you define a developer?<br />
          A developer is a person who is working directly or indirectly on a Basic Primitives software product. This includes front end developers and designers as well as back end developers working on the diagram data and business logic related to serving the diagram. Developers working on completely different modules of your application are not included.
        </li>
        <li>
          If one of our developers leaves, do we have to purchase another developer license for the new one?<br />
          No. The developer license applies to the seat, not the individual.
        </li>
        <li>
          What is license type for ASP.NET component and any other demo components based on Basic Primitives Diagram?<br />
          ASP.NET component uses Basic Primitives Diagram jQuery UI widgets for rendering, so its usage is governed by the same license conditions as Basic Primitives Diagram.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Update policy</h2>
      <p>A commercial license entitles you to use all versions of a Basic Primitives software product released within a year after the purchase date, for all future.</p>
      <h3>What is a commercial website?</h3>
      <p>A commercial website is a website which purpose is generating revenue or cash flow of any type, and that isn't under a non-profit organization. So if you're selling a product, selling advertisement, selling a service or just marketing a commercial business, your site is commercial. A company website is also commercial even if it doesn't sell anything, as it's purpose is to front a commercial company.</p>
      <h3>Non-commercial redistribution</h3>
      <p>You are allowed to distribute a Basic Primitives Diagram&nbsp; software product with non-commercial packages given that you fulfil two conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Emphasize to your users that a Basic Primitives software product is not free for commercial use. You can do this on your download page or when your users activate a Basic Primitives software product in your application.</li>
        <li>Provide a link back to this web page in the same location.</li>
      </ul>
