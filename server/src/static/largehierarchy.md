### Browsing diagram nodes and auto-layout 
* Fitting large diagram into available screen space. Component folds nodes into markers to make the browsing of large hierarchies possible.
* Showing context menu and details for a node in the user focus. Component shows cursor node immediate children and parents details, so the user can click them and browse nodes one by one further around the diagram.
* Selecting and pinning nodes. As a user browses diagram nodes, it may pin the ones it is interested in, so their details stay visible.
