## Demoed features
### Partners
* General partner
* Limited Partner

The organizational chart control provides simplified support for multiple parents, managers, or co-heads in the hierarchy. If a child node item type is a general partner, the component places it at the same level as its logical parent item and visually shares children. General & limited item types cannot have their children but may have advisers & assistants. The limited partner has no connection to the parent node, but it shares children.
