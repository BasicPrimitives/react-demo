* What is the difference between the Developer type licenses and an OEM license?
The OEM license allows you to distribute a Basic Primitives software product in your software or hardware product to be installed on client hardware. However, if you're setting up sites and web applications for a client as a contract job, you are allowed to do this under the Developer type licenses.
* How do you define a developer?
A developer is a person who is working directly or indirectly on a Basic Primitives software product. This includes front end developers and designers as well as back end developers working on the diagram data and business logic related to serving the diagram. Developers working on completely different modules of your application are not included.
* If one of our developers leaves, do we have to purchase another developer license for the new one?
No. The developer license applies to the seat, not the individual.
* What is license type for React component and any other demo components based on Basic Primitives Diagram?
React component uses Basic Primitives Diagram for rendering, so its usage is governed by the same license conditions as Basic Primitives Diagram.
