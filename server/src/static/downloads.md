## Basic Primitives Diagrams for JavaScript Samples, Demos & Tests
It is a JavaScript controls library that implements organizational and multi-parent hierarchical charts. It uses HTML and SVG elements to render diagrams client-side in the browser. 

The package contains a standalone set of PDFkit plugins for the client and server-side diagrams rendering in PDF documents. Plugins use PDF specific features, like PDF annotations and links. Plugins have no browser dependency on HTML to PDF conversion.
