## Demoed features
### Browsing combined with dynamic nodes loading
* This demo dynamically loads chart nodes as the user navigates around the diagram. The top 3 levels stay loaded permanently. All other rows are loaded as the user browses down into them, and control discards them as it navigates out to any other branch of the hierarchy.
* Selecting and pinning nodes. If the user check marks a loaded node, it stays loaded and not discarded when the user swaps to another branch.

### General
* Diagram reset
