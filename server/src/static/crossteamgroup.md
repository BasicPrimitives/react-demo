## Demoed features
This diagram displays the same data set as the Large Hierarchy Demo. But it looks way more compact due to the absence of horizontal scrolling and dense array of labels shown for every node of the diagram.
The application shows cross-functional team members using selection checkmarks and large custom user templates.  If selected nodes are outside the visible viewport area, the component shows them in the form of markers on the diagram's frame. When you start this demo application, you should see them at the bottom of the diagram bounding rectangle. You can click them, and the diagram would scroll them into the viewport.
